To do:

BUGS:
- the @ sign and blindness still doesn't quite work-- when blind and picking
  thing up, the thing doesn't disappear...

- "press return to continue" when at home doesn't do anything

- compressing saved-game files seems not to work. [This now sort of works]

- configure script thinks all sorts of things are ksh

THINGS I'D LIKE:

- blacksmith on top floor to fix negative-bonus weaponry (at some percentage
  of cost of actual weapon. Mostly so I can beat up rust monsters with
  the Flailing Hammer or Slayer and get it fixed afterward...)

- having the bank give interest would be cool.

- an @ sign where the player is, for lame terminals without decent
  cursors (like TeraTerm, or anything that blinks.)
 - still kind of buggy.
